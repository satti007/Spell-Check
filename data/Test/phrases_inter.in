from the eath to the moon
wate fountain at school
roff of the house
a geant leap for mankind
interested in your opinin
hope for the futre
taking an extreem step
walking down the aisel
cops and robers
presient of united states
a few goode men
a briht sunny day
raining cats and doggs
chill down the spene
broken hart
keep out of reech
I cannot thank you enugf
keep your fingers krossd
read bitwin the lines
sky fool of stars
follow the skedule
looosing the plot
hiway to the city
peace of cake
burn the midnite oil
wonder the chair		
after this own		
hind the sofa
oad the table
I dont udrstnd		
To complete the moth problem
moving flow flower to flower
crying the math problem
sevnten hungry lions in the rocks
A fate worse than dead
A golden key can open any doer
A mad after my own heart
a calm sea does not make a skied sailor
constant occpton prevents temptation
a dangerous foreseen is half avoided
early to bed and curly to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise
Experience is the father from wisdom
facts speak blouder than words
frndsip is love with understanding
put all your eggs in one blanket
a rotten apple sols the barrel
